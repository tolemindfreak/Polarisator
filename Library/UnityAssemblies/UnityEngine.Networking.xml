The manager handles adding/removing player objects to the game after a client connection has been set as ready. The ClientScene is a singleton, and it has static convenience methods such as ClientScene.Ready(). The ClientScene is used by the NetworkManager, but it can be used by itself. As the ClientScene manages player objects on the client, it is where clients request to add players. The NetworkManager does this via the ClientScene automatically when auto-add-players is set, but it can be done through code using the function ClientScene.AddPlayer(). This sends an AddPlayer message to the server and will cause a player object to be created for this client. Like NetworkServer, the ClientScene understands the concept of the local client. The function ClientScene.ConnectLocalServer() is used to become a host by starting a local client (when a server is already running).</para>

        <para>The animation of game objects can be networked by this component. There are two models of authority for networked movement: If the object has authority on the client, then it should animated locally on the owning client. The animation state information will be sent from the owning client to the server, then broadcast to all of the other clients. This is common for player objects. If the object has authority on the server, then it should be animated on the server and state information will be sent to all clients. This is common for objects not related to a specific client, such as an enemy unit. The NetworkAnimator synchronizes the animation parameters that are checked in the inspector view. It does not automatically sychronize triggers. The function SetTrigger can by used by an object with authority to fire an animation trigger on other clients.</para>

The NetworkBehaviour component requires a NetworkIdentity on the game object. There can be multiple NetworkBehaviours on a single game object. For an object with sub-components in a heirarchy, the NetworkIdentity must be on the root object, and NetworkBehaviour scripts must also be on the root object.

      <summary>
        <para>A High level network connection. This is used for connections from client-to-server and for connection from server-to-client.</para>
        <para>A NetworkConnection corresponds to a specific connection for a host in the transport layer. It has a connectionId that is assigned by the transport layer and passed to the Initialize function. A NetworkClient has one NetworkConnection. A NetworkServerSimple manages multiple NetworkConnections. The NetworkServer has multiple "remote" connections and a "local" connection for the local client. The NetworkConnection class provides message sending and handling facilities. For sending data over a network, there are methods to send message objects, byte arrays, and NetworkWriter objects. To handle data arriving from the network, handler functions can be registered for message Ids, byte arrays can be processed by HandleBytes(), and NetworkReader object can be processed by HandleReader(). NetworkConnection objects also act as observers for networked objects. When a connection is an observer of a networked object with a NetworkIdentity, then the object will be visible to corresponding client for the connection, and incremental state changes will be sent to the client. NetworkConnection objects can "own" networked game objects. Owned objects will be destroyed on the server by default when the connection is destroyed. A connection owns the player objects created by its client, and other objects with client-authority assigned to the corresponding client. There are many virtual functions on NetworkConnection that allow its behaviour to be customized. NetworkClient and NetworkServer can both be made to instantiate custom classes derived from NetworkConnection by setting their networkConnectionClass member variable.</para>

      <summary>
        <para>The NetworkIdentity identifies objects across the network, between server and clients. Its primary data is a NetworkInstanceId which is allocated by the server and then set on clients. This is used in network communications to be able to lookup game objects on different machines.</para>
        <para>The NetworkIdentity is used to synchronize information in the object with the network. Only the server should create instances of objects which have NetworkIdentity as otherwise they will not be properly connected to the system. For complex objects with a heirarchy of subcomponents, the NetworkIdentity must be on the root of the heirarchy. It is not supported to have multiple NetworkIdentity components on subcomponents of a heirarchy. NetworkBehaviour scripts require a NetworkIdentity on the game object to be able to function. The NetworkIdentity manages the dirty state of the NetworkBehaviours of the object. When it discovers that NetworkBehaviours are dirty, it causes an update packet to be created and sent to clients. The flow for serialization updates managed by the NetworkIdentity is: * Each NetworkBehaviour has a dirty mask. This mask is available inside OnSerialize as syncVarDirtyBits * Each SyncVar in a NetworkBehaviour script is assigned a bit in the dirty mask. * Changing the value of SyncVars causes the bit for that SyncVar to be set in the dirty mask * Alternatively, calling SetDirtyBit() writes directly to the dirty mask * NetworkIdentity objects are checked on the server as part of it’s update loop * If any NetworkBehaviours on a NetworkIdentity are dirty, then an UpdateVars packet is created for that object * The UpdateVars packet is populated by calling OnSerialize on each NetworkBehaviour on the object * NetworkBehaviours that are NOT dirty write a zero to the packet for their dirty bits * NetworkBehaviours that are dirty write their dirty mask, then the values for the SyncVars that have changed * If OnSerialize returns true for a NetworkBehaviour, the dirty mask is reset for that NetworkBehaviour, so it will not send again until its value changes. * The UpdateVars packet is sent to ready clients that are observing the object On the client: * an UpdateVars packet is received for an object * The OnDeserialize function is called for each NetworkBehaviour script on the object * Each NetworkBehaviour script on the object reads a dirty mask. * If the dirty mask for a NetworkBehaviour is zero, the OnDeserialize functions returns without reading any more * If the dirty mask is non-zero value, then the OnDeserialize function reads the values for the SyncVars that correspond to the dirty bits that are set * If there are SyncVar hook functions, those are invoked with the value read from the stream.</para>

    <member name="T:UnityEngine.Networking.NetworkMigrationManager">
      <summary>
        <para>A component that manages the process of a new host taking over a game when the old host is lost. This is referred to as "host migration". The migration manager sends information about each peer in the game to all the clients, and when the host is lost because of a crash or network outage, the clients are able to choose a new host, and continue the game. The old host is able to rejoin the new game on the new host. The state of SyncVars and SyncLists on all objects with NetworkIdentities in the scene is maintained during a host migration. This also applies to custom serialized data for objects. All of the player objects in the game are disabled when the host is lost. Then, when the other clients rejoin the new game on the new host, the corresponding players for those clients are re-enabled on the host, and respawned on the other clients. No player state data is lost during a host migration.</para>
        <para>This class provides a simple default UI for controlling the behaviour when the host is lost. The UI can be disabled with the showGUI property. There are a number of virtual functions that can be implemented to customize the behaviour of host migration. Note that only data that is available to clients will be preserved during a host migration. If there is data that is only on the server, then it will not be available to the client that becomes the new host. This means data on the host that is not in SyncVars or SyncLists will not be available after a host migration. The callback function OnStartServer is invoked for all networked objects when the client becomes a new host. On the new host, the NetworkMigrationManager uses the function NetworkServer.BecomeNewHost() to construct a networked server scene from the state in the current ClientScene. The peers in a game with host migration enabled are identified by their connectionId on the server. When a client reconnects to the new host of a game, this connectionId is passed to the new host so that it can match this client with the client that was connected to the old host. This Id is set on the ClientScene as the "reconnectId". The old host of the game, the one that crashed or lost its network connection, can also reconnect to the new game as a client. This client uses the special ReconnectId of ClientScene.ReconnectIdHost (which is zero).</para>

        <para>NetworkServer handles remote connections from remote clients via a NetworkServerSimple instance, and also has a local connection for a local client. The NetworkServer is a singleton. It has static convenience functions such as NetworkServer.SendToAll() and NetworkServer.Spawn() which automatically use the singleton instance. The NetworkManager uses the NetworkServer, but it can be used without the NetworkManager. The set of networked objects that have been spawned is managed by NetworkServer. Objects are spawned with NetworkServer.Spawn() which adds them to this set, and makes them be created on clients. Spawned objects are removed automatically when they are destroyed, or than they can be removed from the spawned set by calling NetworkServer.UnSpawn() - this does not destroy the object. There are a number of internal messages used by NetworkServer, these are setup when NetworkServer.Listen() is called.</para>

You should call this initially with a page number starting at zero, and a reasonable page size (for example, 10). Too large a page will slow down the time required to download the information related to these matches. The callback will be invoked with data containing up to the resultPageSize as the number of matches (for example, if startPageNumber is currently 3 and resultPageSize is 5, the data passed into the callback will be the matches that correspond to results 15-20 in the list of results).

If there is no cached asset bundle, or if the cached asset bundle's <c>hash</c> matches the <c>hash</c> argument, then the system will skip downloading the asset bundle and instead load it from the cache. If there is a cached asset bundle, but the cached bundle's <c>hash</c> does not match the <c>hash</c> argument, then the system will re-download the asset bundle from <c>url</c>. If the <c>crc</c> argument is non-zero, then the <c>crc</c> argument will be compared to the checksum of the downloaded data. If the CRCs do not match, an error will be logged, the asset bundle will not be loaded, and assetBundle will return <c>null</c>. If you do not wish to use CRC integrity checking, pass zero as the <c>crc</c> argument.</para>

        <para>The initialState flag is useful to differentiate between the first time an object is serialized and when incremental updates can be sent. The first time an object is sent to a client, it must include a full state snapshot, but subsequent updates can save on bandwidth by including only incremental changes. Note that SyncVar hook functions are not called when initialState is true, only for incremental updates. If a class has SyncVars, then an implementation of this function and OnDeserialize() are added automatically to the class. So a class that has SyncVars cannot also have custom serialization functions. The OnSerialize function should return true to indicate that an update should be sent. If it returns true, then the dirty bits for that script are set to zero, if it returns false then the dirty bits are not changed. This allows multiple changes to a script to be accumulated over time and sent when the system is ready, instead of every frame.</para>

You can override this behavior by specifying a particular data center. Keep in mind generally as distance grows so does latency, which is why we run data centers spread out over the world.

        <para>Unlike most NetworkBehaviour scripts, for NetworkTransform this is implemented at a per-object level rather than at the per-script level. This allows more flexibility as this component is used in various situation. If sendInterval is non-zero, then transform state updates are send at most once every sendInterval seconds. However, if an object is stationary, no updates are sent. If sendInterval is zero, then no automatic updates are sent. In this case, calling SetDirtyBits() on the NetworkTransform will cause an updates to be sent. This could be used for objects like bullets that have a predictable trajectory.</para>

If the <see cref="UnityEngine.Networking.UnityWebRequest" /> encounters and follows redirects, this property will be updated with the URL to which the <see cref="UnityEngine.Networking.UnityWebRequest" /> was redirected. When inputting URLs, absolute URLs are preferred. However, if you input a partial URL, the system will follow these rules: If the input URL starts with two slashes (//), then the input is assumed to be a domain and path intended for use over HTTP. On non-WebGL platforms, the system will prepend <c>http:</c>. On WebGL, the system will inherit the scheme of the path by which the Unity WebGL application is being accessed. Examples: If the WebGL app is being accessed via https, the system will prepend <c>https:</c>. If the WebGL app is being accessed via http, the system will prepend <c>http:</c>. If the input URL starts with a single slash (/), then the system assumes the inout is a path relative to the current domain on which the Unity application is running. On non-WebGL platforms, the system will prepend <c>http://localhost</c> to the URL. On WebGL, the system will prepend the scheme and host of the path by which the Unity WebGL application is being accessed. For example, if the Unity WebGL app is being accessed via <c>http://unity3d.com/myapp</c>, then the system will prepend <c>http://unity3d.com</c> to relative paths. If neither of the above rules apply, the system validates your input string via the built-in <c>System.Uri</c> class. If this class throws a <c>URIFormatException</c>, the system attempts to append the input string to the absolute URL by which the Unity app is being accessed. (see above) Any further exceptions will be re-thrown.</para>

      <summary>
        <para>Determines whether this UnityWebRequest will include <c>Expect: 100-Continue</c> in its outgoing request headers. (Default: <c>true</c>).</para>
        <para>If this property is set to <c>true</c>, then this UnityWebRequest will include an <c>Expect: 100-Continue</c> header in the initial outbound request. If set to <c>false</c>, an empty <c>Expect</c> header will be sent, which will suppress usage of the <c>100 Continue</c> response code. As detailed in <see href="rfc2616-sec8" cref="RFC 2616, Section 8" />, the <c>100 Continue</c> response code is intended to allow a remote server to decide whether or not it will accept a request based on a request's headers, prior to the client transmitting the full request body. This is useful in cases where the client need not transmit its full request to every server in a request/response chain, such as in a load-balanced application. For example, a client would present its request, with a <c>Expect: 100-Continue</c> header, to a load-balancing server. The load-balancing server would then respond with a redirect to a processing server. Next, the client would connect to the processing server and transmit the same request, again with a <c>Expect: 100-Continue</c> server. The processing server would then respond with a <c>100 Continue</c> HTTP status code, and the client would finally respond with the full body of its request. By using the <c>100 Continue</c> status code, the client only had to transmit the full body of its request to one server. If not using the <c>100 Continue</c> status code, the client must transmit the full body of its request to every server it communicates with, needlessly consuming bandwidth and processing time on both the client and any servers issuing redirects. In general, one should leave <c>100 Continue</c> enabled. Exceptions include requests which have a very small or no request body, or applications where the client knows the server will not issue a redirect. This property defaults to <c>true</c>. Note: On WebGL build targets, header negotiation is performed by the host browser. Therefore, this setting's value has no effect on WebGL builds.</para>

Both strings must be non-null and contain a minimum of 1 character. This method cannot be called after <see cref="UnityEngine.Networking.UnityWebRequest.Send" /> has been called. These headers cannot be set with custom values on any platform: <c>accept-charset</c>, <c>access-control-request-headers</c>, <c>access-control-request-method</c>, <c>connection</c>, <c>date</c>, <c>dnt</c>, <c>expect</c>, <c>host</c>, <c>keep-alive</c>, <c>origin</c>, <c>referer</c>, <c>te</c>, <c>trailer</c>, <c>transfer-encoding</c>, <c>upgrade</c>, <c>via</c>. It is possible to set a custom value for the <c>accept-encoding</c> header but the resulting behavior is unreliable so it is strongly recommended to let it be automatically handled unless you can accept the risk of unexpected results.
