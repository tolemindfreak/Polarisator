        <para>The layout system will invoke CalculateLayoutInputHorizontal before querying minWidth, preferredWidth, and flexibleWidth. It can potentially save performance if these properties are cached when CalculateLayoutInputHorizontal is invoked, so they don't need to be recalculated every time the properties are queried. The layout system will invoke CalculateLayoutInputVertical before querying minHeight, preferredHeight, and flexibleHeight. It can potentially save performance if these properties are cached when CalculateLayoutInputVertical is invoked, so they don't need to be recalculated every time the properties are queried. The minWidth, preferredWidth, and flexibleWidth properties should not rely on any properties of the RectTransform of the layout element, otherwise the behavior will be non-deterministic. The minHeight, preferredHeight, and flexibleHeight properties may rely on horizontal aspects of the RectTransform, such as the width or the X component of the position. Any properties of the RectTransforms on child layout elements may always be relied on.</para>

        <para>Handles input, raycasting, and sending events.</para>
        <para>The EventSystem is responsible for processing and handling events in a Unity scene. A scene should only contain one EventSystem. The EventSystem works in conjunction with a number of modules and mostly just holds state and delegates functionality to specific, overrideable components. When the EventSystem is started it searches for any <see cref="UnityEngine.EventSystems.BaseInputModule" />s attached to the same <see cref="UnityEngine.GameObject" /> and adds them to an internal list. On update each attached module receives an <see cref="UnityEngine.EventSystems.EventSystem.UpdateModules" /> call, where the module can modify internal state. After each module has been Updated the active module has the Process call executed. This is where custom module processing can take place.</para>

      <summary>
        <para>The Canvas Scaler component is used for controlling the overall scale and pixel density of UI elements in the Canvas. This scaling affects everything under the Canvas, including font sizes and image borders.</para>
        <para>For a Canvas set to 'Screen Space - Overlay' or 'Screen Space - Camera', the Canvas Scaler UI Scale Mode can be set to Constant Pixel Size, Scale With Screen Size, or Constant Physical Size. Using the Constant Pixel Size mode, positions and sizes of UI elements are specified in pixels on the screen. This is also the default functionality of the Canvas when no Canvas Scaler is attached. However, With the Scale Factor setting in the Canvas Scaler, a constant scaling can be applied to all UI elements in the Canvas. Using the Scale With Screen Size mode, positions and sizes can be specified according to the pixels of a specified reference resolution. If the current screen resolution is larger then the reference resolution, the Canvas will keep having only the resolution of the reference resolution, but will scale up in order to fit the screen. If the current screen resolution is smaller than the reference resolution, the Canvas will similarly be scaled down to fit. If the current screen resolution has a different aspect ratio than the reference resolution, scaling each axis individually to fit the screen would result in non-uniform scaling, which is generally undesirable. Instead of this, the ReferenceResolution component will make the Canvas resolution deviate from the reference resolution in order to respect the aspect ratio of the screen. It is possible to control how this deviation should behave using the <see cref="UnityEngine.UI.CanvasScaler.screenMatchMode" /> setting. Using the Constant Physical Size mode, positions and sizes of UI elements are specified in physical units, such as millimeters, points, or picas. This mode relies on the device reporting its screen DPI correctly. You can specify a fallback DPI to use for devices that do not report a DPI. For a Canvas set to 'World Space' the Canvas Scaler can be used to control the pixel density of UI elements in the Canvas.</para>

    <member name="T:UnityEngine.UI.DefaultControls">
      <summary>
        <para>Utility class for creating default implementations of builtin UI controls.</para>
        <para>The recommended workflow for using UI controls with the UI system is to create a prefab for each type of control and instantiate those when needed. This way changes can be made to the prefabs which immediately have effect on all used instances. However, in certain cases there can be reasons to create UI controls entirely from code. The DefaultControls class provide methods to create each of the builtin UI controls. The resulting objects are the same as are obtained from using the corresponding UI menu entries in the GameObject menu in the Editor. An example use of this is creating menu items for custom new UI controls that mimics the ones that are builtin in Unity. Some such UI controls may contain other UI controls. For example, a scroll view contains scrollbars. By using the DefaultControls methods to create those parts, it is ensured that they are identical in look and setup to the ones provided in the menu items builtin with Unity. Note that the details of the setup of the UI controls created by the methods in this class may change with later revisions of the UI system. As such, they are not guaranteed to be 100% backwards compatible. It is recommended not to rely on the specific hierarchies of the GameObjects created by these methods, and limit your code to only interface with the root GameObject created by each method.</para>

The fill, when used, spans from the minimum value to the current value while the handle, when used, follow the current value. The anchors of the fill and handle RectTransforms are driven by the Slider. The fill and handle can be direct children of the GameObject with the Slider, or intermediary RectTransforms can be placed in between for additional control. When a change to the slider value occurs, a callback is sent to any registered listeners of <see cref="UnityEngine.UI.Slider.onValueChanged" />.</para>

        <para>Setting to scale the Canvas to match the width or height of the reference resolution, or a combination.</para>
        <para>If the setting is set to 0, the Canvas is scaled according to the difference between the current screen resolution width and the reference resolution width. If the setting is set to 1, the Canvas is scaled according to the difference between the current screen resolution height and the reference resolution height. For values in between 0 and 1, the scaling is based on a combination of the relative width and height. Consider an example where the reference resolution of 640x480, and the current screen resolution is a landscape mode of 480x640. If the scaleWidthOrHeight setting is set to 0, the Canvas is scaled by 0.75 because the current resolution width of 480 is 0.75 times the reference resolution width of 640. The Canvas resolution gets a resolution of 640x853.33. This resolution has the same width as the reference resolution width, but has the aspect ratio of the current screen resolution. Note that the Canvas resolution of 640x853.33 is the current screen resolution divided by the scale factor of 0.75. If the scaleWidthOrHeight setting is set to 1, the Canvas is scaled by 1.33 because the current resolution height of 640 is 1.33 times the reference resolution height of 480. The Canvas resolution gets a resolution of 360x480. This resolution has the same height as the reference resolution width, but has the aspect ratio of the current screen resolution. Note that the Canvas resolution of 360x480 is the current screen resolution divided by the scale factor of 1.33. If the scaleWidthOrHeight setting is set to 0.5, we find the horizontal scaling needed (0.75) and the vertical scaling needed (1.33) and find the average. However, we do the average in logarithmic space. A regular average of 0.75 and 1.33 would produce a result of 1.04. However, since multiplying by 1.33 is the same as diving by 0.75, the two scale factor really corresponds to multiplying by 0.75 versus dividing by 0.75, and the average of those two things should even out and produce a neutral result. The average in logarithmic space of 0.75 and 1.33 is exactly 1.0, which is what we want. The Canvas resolution hence ends up being 480x640 which is the current resolution divided by the scale factor of 1.0. The logic works the same for all values. The average between the horizontal and vertical scale factor is a weighted average based on the matchWidthOrHeight value.</para>
